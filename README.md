# Personal Goals

# I AM AN INTERN!!!!

Thanks to Ben Halpern for reaching out to me for the apprentice position at [The Practical Dev](https://dev.to).

I work with some really smart, talented developers. I am truly grateful for the opportunity.

Hope these three months are as fruitful to you as they are to me.

Personal goals made open source.

Why? Spending the time to get shit done. I'm open sourcing these goals for accessibility across computers I use, transparency, accountability, and versioning.
