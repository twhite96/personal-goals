# This Weeks Accomplishments: October 8-15, 2017
I've been working on YelpCamp pretty much all week. I've also been digging React and Redux, as well as working on Check Yo Self. I wrote one blog post on Tiffany R. White Blog.

## This Week's Goal: Get Better
I have gotten somewhat better. Still need a refresher on vanilla JavaScript syntax.

## Things I Did From the List:
Everything but three things: data structures and algorithm reading, and working on the cs-web-dev path repo.

### Additional Things I Did:
Wrote blog posts for my other blog. Tried to get the animation working on my 404 page for Check Yo Self. Worked on some Treehouse courses and answered Treehouse Community questions.

## Things I Didn't Get to/Finish:
Read about data structures and algorithms and the cs-math web dev repo. ðŸ˜•

## Next Week's Goal: 
*Work harder*.

## Things I'll do Next Week:
Work on YelpCamp for another 6 hours and React and Redux for another 5 hours. Also start the Intro to Docker course on Treehouse.

### Week in Review
Did all the things!
