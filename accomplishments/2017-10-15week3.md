# This Weeks Accomplishments: October 15-22, 2017

## This Week's Goal: *Work Harder*
Definitely did this. I worked practically all week.

## Things I Did From the List:
Finished YelpCamp ✅. [YelpCamp App](https://yelpcamp96.herokuapp.com/). Worked on Check Yo Self. Found I will need to add React or Angular in order to use MDL. Wrote a blog post. Huh. Just basically building YelpCamp.

### Additional Things I Did:
Work on the CS Web Dev Path w/ Math track repo.

## Things I Didn't Get to/Finish:
Didn't get to answer Treehouse Community questions. Didn't read any books. I am not really reading a whole lot of books lately which concerns me. I've been reading since I was 3 years old and take pride in being well-read. Been really busy. Sucks...😕

## Next Week's Goal: *Keep Going*

## Things I'll do Next Week:
YelpCamp is finished now so it is just tweaking it. I need to keep working on the React and Redux course and Check Yo Self. Blog posts need to be written and **I need to read books. End of.**

### Week in Review
Awesome week. Kicked complete ass 💪🏽 🔥
